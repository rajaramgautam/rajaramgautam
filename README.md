### DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS:
#### Enron Email Analysis:                          March 2022
Unsupervised Machine Learning Project using NLP and Time Series and determined identifiable trends in email topics over time using topic modeling. Our analysis could help organization to identify key themes of communication between person of interest in early stage of investigating suspicious activity.

#### Natural Language Processing:         February 2022
Determined language used in a repository based on the contents of that repository's README file. Web scraped the repo name, programming language, and README contents from 230 repositories on GitHub. Using a Logistic Regression model, we were able to achieve 13.5% accuracy in our predictions, beating the baseline.

#### Individual Project:                             January 2022
Modeled the New York City Property data using properties features, the Polynomial Model with degree 2 produced the best results with RMSE values of 285585, 283355 and 284915 for train, validate and test dataset. My model performed 9.40% better than the baseline model (when comparing training data set) and 8.00 % better than the baseline model for validate dataset.

#### Clustering Project:                              December 2021
Exploring Zillow’s data, our model predict the drivers of errors in Zestimate with little bit better accuracy than baseline accuracy. Clustering was done based on location features (latitude, longitude, zip code) In most of our models, their performance was better without clustering than with clustering.

#### Linear Regression:                               December 2021
Created multiple regression models utilizing home features to predict home tax values using Zillow data. Among various models, Polynomial Model with degree 2 produced the best results with RMSE values of 208506, 211676 and 213560 for train, test, and validate dataset. Our best model performed 14.30% and 13.21% better than baseline for training and validate dataset.

#### Classification:                                   November 2021
To Identify driving factors of customer churn from Telco Inc. with help of data provided which is in my GitHub. Our best Random Forest Classifier model performed 7% better than baseline and had an accuracy of 80% on unseen test data.
